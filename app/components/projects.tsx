      description: "Developed an intelligent route optimization system using genetic algorithms in Python that efficiently solves the classic Traveling Salesman Problem through bio-inspired computation. The application features a real-time visualization interface built with Tkinter and Matplotlib, implementing two distinct crossover methods that achieve up to 56% route optimization. Using NumPy for efficient data processing, the system can find optimal routes for 100-city problems in approximately 25 seconds, while providing interactive visualization of the evolution process.",
